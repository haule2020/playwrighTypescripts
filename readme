### Keys for isolation, speed, and maintainability
  - The Page Object Model (POM) is applied to page classes, encapsulate all the messy selectors and UI interactions
  - Each test runs in a completely separate browser context
  - Each test runs with indipendent test data
  - JSON file holds test data (category + product).
  - Test Loop through JSON to generate multiple tests dynamically.
  - Validating API Calls Triggered by the UI to monitor network traffic during UI interactions
  - Test Suites (test.describe): Group related tests for readability and modularity.
  - Tests can run fullyParallel in both CI and Local
  - Tests retry on fisrt failure
